## Intro

Raspberry Pi and other [SBCs](## "Single Board Computers") can emulate a USB drive, so can act as a drive for your Tesla to write dashcam footage to. Because the SBC has full access to the emulated drive, it can:

- automatically copy the recordings to an archive server when you get home
- hold both dashcam recordings and music files
- automatically repair filesystem corruption produced by the Tesla's current failure to properly dismount the USB drives before cutting power to the USB ports
- serve up a web UI to view or download the recordings
- retain more than one hour of RecentClips (assuming large enough storage)
